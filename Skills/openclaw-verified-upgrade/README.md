# openclaw-verified-upgrade

A reliability-first OpenClaw upgrade skill.

This skill helps an agent upgrade OpenClaw with a “set-and-forget” user experience while keeping the internal guardrails strict enough for real gateway operations. It treats upgrade as a verified state transition, not as “run an update command and hope.”

## When to use

Use this skill when you want to:

- Upgrade OpenClaw safely.
- Choose between latest, a specific version, or a recommended stable version.
- Check release notes before upgrading.
- Avoid breaking a running Gateway, channel, plugin, model, or agent route.
- Recover from a partial or failed OpenClaw upgrade.

## Core idea

**An OpenClaw upgrade is not complete until the running Gateway is verified healthy.**

The skill explicitly distinguishes:

- CLI/package version
- Running Gateway/runtime version
- Service manager path, such as LaunchAgent/systemd/manual process
- Config validity
- Plugin/channel/agent availability
- User-critical workflows

This matters because the CLI can be upgraded while an existing Gateway process continues running an older version.

## Ordinary-user flow

The user should only need to choose:

```text
1. Recommended stable version (default)
2. Latest version
3. Specific version
```

The agent then handles the operational detail internally:

1. Detect the current environment.
2. Discover current OpenClaw commands and semantics.
3. Pick or verify a target version.
4. Review release notes and upgrade risks.
5. Build a checklist of user-critical paths.
6. Check pre-upgrade health.
7. Create a verified local backup.
8. Ask for final confirmation before mutation.
9. Upgrade using the current supported path.
10. Restart/reload the correct Gateway manager if needed.
11. Verify CLI, running Gateway, config, logs, channels, plugins, agents, and critical paths.
12. Report evidence or stop safely with a recovery plan.

## Key safeguards

- Latest is not automatically best.
- OpenClaw commands and flags are version-sensitive.
- Command discovery must happen before command execution.
- Command existence is not enough; command semantics must be confirmed.
- Release notes and migration risks must be reviewed before upgrade.
- Backup must be created and read-back verified before mutation.
- One approval does not authorize every recovery action.
- Retry logic must be failure-classified and capped.
- Rollback requires prior explicit authorization unless already granted.
- Success requires evidence, not just exit code 0.

## Backup requirements

Before changing anything, the agent should create a timestamped local backup manifest containing at least:

- OpenClaw config file.
- Current CLI version/path.
- Gateway/service status.
- Service command/path and running process path when available.
- Config validation result.
- Install/package metadata.
- Critical path baseline.
- Target version and release-risk summary.

If backup creation or read-back verification fails, the upgrade must stop.

## Verification requirements

After upgrade, the agent must verify:

- CLI/package version equals the target.
- Running Gateway/runtime version equals the target, or provide equivalent runtime evidence.
- Running process path matches the upgraded installation.
- Gateway status/connectivity is healthy.
- Config validation or doctor-equivalent check passes.
- Logs show no fresh fatal startup errors.
- Important plugins/channels/agents/routes still work.
- A minimal end-to-end check passes when safe and supported.

## Failure behavior

If something fails, the skill requires the agent to:

- Stop mutation immediately.
- Classify the failure.
- Refresh current state before retrying.
- Retry only safe, bounded, recoverable steps.
- Preserve logs and evidence.
- Ask before rollback, config overwrite, daemon edits, reinstall, cleanup, sudo, or downgrade unless pre-authorized.

## Publishing note

This skill is intended to be reusable and GitHub-friendly. It should not contain local secrets, user-specific credentials, or hard-coded commands that imply universal compatibility across OpenClaw versions.
